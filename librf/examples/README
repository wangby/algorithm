TRAINING:

This is how to train a random forest from training data and save the model to disk.
Currently, the default is a CSV format delimited by ',' with no header.
However, a header(with variable names) and special delimeter can be
specified (most commonly ' ') 

USAGE: 
   ./rftrain  [-p <probs>] [-k <int>] [-t <int>] -m <rfmodel> -d
              <trainingdata> [-f <int>] [-l <labels>] [--csv] [--header]
              [--delim <delimiter>] [--importance] [--] [--version] [-h]

EXAMPLE:
./rftrain -t 100 -m heart.model -d ../data/heart.csv --header --csv -l ../data/heart_labels.txt 

 -p <probfile>-- outputs out-of-bag probabilities for each instance to
 <probfile>
 -k <int> -- number of variables to try at each split
